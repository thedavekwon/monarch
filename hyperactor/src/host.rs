//! This module defines [`Host`], which represents all the procs running on a host.
//! The procs themselves are managed by an implementation of [`ProcManager`], which may,
//! for example, fork new processes for each proc, or spawn them in the same process
//! for testing purposes.
//!
//! The primary purpose of a host is to manage the lifecycle of these procs, and to
//! serve as a single front-end for all the procs on a host, multiplexing network
//! channels.
//!
//! ## Channel muxing
//!
//! A [`Host`] maintains a single frontend address, through which all procs are accessible
//! through direct addressing: the id of each proc is the `ProcId::Direct(frontend_addr, proc_name)`.
//! In the following, the frontend address is denoted by `*`. The host listens on `*` and
//! multiplexes messages based on the proc name. When spawning procs, the host maintains
//! backend channels with separate addresses. In the diagram `#` is the backend address of
//! the host, while `#n` is the backend address for proc *n*. The host forwards messages
//! to the appropriate backend channel, while procs forward messages to the host backend
//! channel at `#`.
//!
