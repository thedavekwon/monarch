//! Mesh-topology introspection types and attrs.
//!
//! This module owns the typed internal model used by mesh-admin and the
//! TUI: mesh-topology attr keys, typed attrs views, `NodeRef`, and the
//! domain `NodePayload` / `NodeProperties` / `FailureInfo` values derived
//! from `hyperactor::introspect::IntrospectResult`.
//!
//! These keys are published by `HostMeshAgent`, `ProcAgent`, and
//! `MeshAdminAgent` to describe mesh topology (hosts, procs, root).
//! Actor-runtime keys (status, actor_type, messages_processed, etc.) are
//! declared in `hyperactor::introspect`.
//!
//! The HTTP wire representations live in [`dto`]. That submodule owns the
//! curl-friendly JSON contract, schema/OpenAPI generation, and boundary
//! invariants for string-encoded references and timestamps. This module
//! keeps the internal typed invariants.
//!
//! These invariants govern the introspection model and derived
//! payloads exposed by mesh-admin; lower-level runtime accounting
//! invariants remain owned by the runtime modules that produce those
//! values.
//!
//! See `hyperactor::introspect` for naming convention, invariant
//! labels, and the `IntrospectAttr` meta-attribute pattern.
//!
//! ## Mesh key invariants (MK-*)
//!
//! - **MK-1 (metadata completeness):** Every mesh-topology
//!   introspection key must carry `@meta(INTROSPECT = ...)` with
//!   non-empty `name` and `desc`.
//! - **MK-2 (short-name uniqueness):** Covered by
//!   `test_introspect_short_names_are_globally_unique` in
//!   `hyperactor::introspect` (cross-crate).
//!
//! ## Proc debug stats invariants (PD-*)
//!
//! These invariants govern the proc-debug introspection surface
//! exposed by mesh-admin: proc attrs, typed proc views, and the
//! proc-debug portion of `NodeProperties::Proc`.
//!
//! They do not define proc runtime mechanics. The underlying
//! per-actor queue-depth accounting invariants live in
//! `hyperactor::proc`; this module owns the proc-level debug values
//! derived from that runtime state.
//!
//! - **PD-1:** `actor_work_queue_depth_max <=
//!   actor_work_queue_depth_total`.
//! - **PD-2:** `process_rss_bytes` and `process_vm_size_bytes` are
//!   `None` on non-Linux or read failure. Never fabricated.
//! - **PD-3:** All debug fields default to zero/None for backward
//!   compatibility. Old procs that haven't published yet produce a
//!   valid `ProcDebugStats::default()`.
//! - **PD-4:** Queue depth aggregation covers live actors only.
//!   Stopped/retained actor snapshots are excluded.
//! - **PD-5:** See `hyperactor::proc` module doc for the per-actor
//!   queue depth accounting invariants (PD-5a through PD-5e).
//!
//! ## HTTP boundary invariants (HB-*)
//!
//! These govern the HTTP DTO layer in [`dto`].
//!
//! - **HB-1 (typed-internal, string-external):** `NodeRef`, `ActorAddr`,
//!   `ProcAddr`, and `SystemTime` are typed Rust values internally. At the
//!   HTTP JSON boundary, [`dto::NodePayloadDto`],
//!   [`dto::NodePropertiesDto`], and [`dto::FailureInfoDto`] encode them
//!   as canonical strings.
//! - **HB-2 (round-trip):** The HTTP string forms round-trip through the
//!   internal typed parsers (`NodeRef::from_str`, `ActorAddr::from_str`,
//!   `humantime::parse_rfc3339`). Timestamps are formatted at
//!   millisecond precision; sub-millisecond values are truncated at
//!   the boundary.
//! - **HB-3 (schema-honesty):** Schema/OpenAPI are generated from the DTO
//!   types, so the published schema reflects the actual wire format rather
//!   than the internal domain representation.
//!
//! ## Attrs invariants (IA-*)
//!
//! These govern how `IntrospectResult.attrs` is built in
//! `hyperactor::introspect` and how `properties` is derived via
//! `derive_properties`.
//!
//! - **IA-1 (attrs-json):** `IntrospectResult.attrs` is always a
//!   valid JSON object string.
//! - **IA-2 (runtime-precedence):** Runtime-owned introspection keys
//!   override any same-named keys in published attrs.
//! - **IA-3 (status-shape):** `status_reason` is present in attrs
//!   iff the status string carries a reason.
//! - **IA-4 (failure-shape):** `failure_*` attrs are present iff
//!   effective status is `failed`.
//! - **IA-5 (payload-totality):** Every `IntrospectResult` sets
//!   `attrs` -- never omitted, never null.
//! - **IA-6 (open-row-forward-compat):** View decoders ignore
//!   unknown attrs keys; only required known keys and local
//!   invariants affect decoding outcome. Concretized by AV-3.
//!
//! ## Attrs view invariants (AV-*)
//!
//! These govern the typed view layer (`*AttrsView` structs).
//!
//! - **AV-1 (view-roundtrip):** For each view V,
//!   `V::from_attrs(&v.to_attrs()) == Ok(v)` (modulo documented
//!   normalization/defaulting).
//! - **AV-2 (required-key-strictness):** `from_attrs` fails iff
//!   required keys for that view are missing.
//! - **AV-3 (unknown-key-tolerance):** Unknown attrs keys must
//!   not affect successful decode outcome. Concretization of
//!   IA-6.
//!
//! ## Derive invariants (DP-*)
//!
//! - **DP-1 (derive-precedence):** `derive_properties` dispatches
//!   on `status` first (DP-5), then `node_type`, then `error_code`,
//!   then unknown. This order is the canonical detection chain.
//! - **DP-2 (derive-totality-on-parse-failure):**
//!   `derive_properties` is total; malformed or incoherent attrs
//!   never panic and map to `NodeProperties::Error` with detail.
//! - **DP-3 (derive-precedence-stability):**
//!   `derive_properties` detection order is stable and explicit:
//!   `status` > `node_type` > `error_code` > unknown.
//! - **DP-4 (error-on-decode-failure):** Any view decode or
//!   invariant failure maps to a deterministic
//!   `NodeProperties::Error` with a `malformed_*` code family,
//!   without panic.
//! - **DP-5 (actor-view classification safety):** a payload
//!   carrying the core `STATUS` key always decodes as `Actor`.
//!   `STATUS` is set only by the blanket Actor builder
//!   (`build_actor_attrs`) and is core-owned, so the actor-attrs
//!   snapshot seam can neither remove nor override it (AS-2), and no
//!   non-actor payload (root/host/proc/error) carries it. Therefore
//!   an actor cannot inject `node_type`/`error_code` via the seam to
//!   spoof a different node kind.
//!
//! ## Execution presentation (EX-*)
//!
//! These govern the `execution` field on `NodeProperties::Actor` — an
//! actor's in-flight handler execution, reported through the generic
//! actor-attrs snapshot seam (`AS-*` in `hyperactor::introspect`) and
//! decoded from the `EXECUTION` attr in `derive_properties`.
//!
//! - **EX-1 (unsupported-vs-idle):** `execution: None` means the actor
//!   does not report execution (no snapshot installed) -- *unsupported*,
//!   not idle. A supported-but-idle actor is `Some` with
//!   `active_count == 0`.
//! - **EX-2 (partial-detail, never absence):** `complete == false`
//!   means the per-handler detail was momentarily unavailable on that
//!   read (e.g. a non-blocking tracker miss); `active_count` stays
//!   authoritative and the field stays `Some` -- contention never
//!   collapses `execution` to `None`.
//! - **EX-3 (observational, not transactional):** `active_count` and
//!   `active_handlers` are independent point-in-time reads;
//!   `active_count` need not equal `sum(active_handlers[*].active_count)`
//!   on a given poll (cf. IO-3). Consumers must not derive one from the
//!   other.
//! - **EX-4 (deterministic truncation):** `active_handlers` is ordered
//!   oldest-first with a stable tie-break on `name`; `truncated == true`
//!   means it is a prefix of the N oldest while `active_count` remains
//!   the full total.
//! - **EX-5 (post-mortem semantics):** a terminated actor's stored
//!   snapshot persists its last `live_actor_payload`, so `execution`
//!   reflects state *as of termination*. The producer drains in-flight
//!   entries on stop (try/finally), so a stopped actor reports
//!   `active_count == 0`.
//!
//! ## Inbound ordering presentation (IO-*)
//!
//! Mesh-admin presentation extension of the cross-crate `IO-*`
//! family. The lower-level invariants `IO-1` (tri-state absence),
//! `IO-2` (publish-time `try_lock`), and `IO-3` (no arithmetic
//! relation between `queue_depth` and reorder-buffer depth) live in
//! `hyperactor::introspect`. The presentation layer below adds:
//!
//! - **IO-4 (snapshot_complete derivation):**
//!   `InboundOrdering.snapshot_complete ==
//!   (skipped_session_count == 0)`. Mirrors
//!   `OrderingSnapshot::is_complete()` at the presentation layer. By
//!   IO-2, the aggregate lock makes this an availability check: `true`
//!   means every session was observed and `false` means none were.
//! - **IO-5 (complete-snapshot exactness):** When
//!   `snapshot_complete == true`, `known_session_count ==
//!   sessions.len()` and every `returned_*` rollup is exact over that
//!   complete session set.
//! - **IO-6 (unavailable-snapshot sentinel):** When
//!   `snapshot_complete == false`, the aggregate sequencing lock was
//!   busy and no session state was observed. The current producer
//!   returns `sessions == []`, `skipped_session_count == 1`, and zero
//!   `returned_*` rollups; the legacy presentation derivation therefore
//!   sets `known_session_count == 1`. These are fixed unavailability
//!   sentinel values, not observations of one session with zero stalls.
//!   Consumers must retry rather than diagnose from them.
//! - **IO-7 (live-actor exposure):** For any actor built through
//!   `Instance::new`, `/v1/{actor}` exposes
//!   `inbound_ordering: Some(...)` -- never `None`. `None`
//!   indicates either structural absence (test fixtures,
//!   hand-built `InstanceCellState`) or a regression in the
//!   publish path.
//!
//! ## py-spy integration (PS-*)
//!
//! - **PS-1 (target locality):** `PySpyDump` always targets
//!   `std::process::id()` of the handling ProcAgent process. No
//!   caller-supplied PID exists in the API.
//! - **PS-2 (deterministic failure shape):** Execution failures are
//!   classified into `BinaryNotFound { searched }` vs
//!   `Failed { pid, binary, exit_code, stderr }`, never collapsed.
//! - **PS-3 (binary resolution order):** Resolution order is exactly:
//!   `PYSPY_BIN` config attr (if non-empty) then `"py-spy"` on PATH.
//!   The attr is read via `hyperactor_config::global::get_cloned`;
//!   env var `PYSPY_BIN` feeds in through the config layer.
//!   If the first attempt is not found, the fallback attempt is
//!   required.
//! - **PS-4 (structured JSON output):** py-spy runs with `--json`;
//!   output is parsed into `Vec<PySpyStackTrace>`. A successful result's
//!   `capture_mode` records whether it used `native_all`, `native`, or
//!   `python_only`. Parse failure maps to `PySpyResult::Failed`.
//! - **PS-5 (subprocess timeout):** `try_exec` bounds the py-spy
//!   subprocess inside the worker to `MESH_ADMIN_PYSPY_TIMEOUT`
//!   (default 10s). The budget is sized for `--native --native-all`
//!   which unwinds native stacks via libunwind — significantly
//!   slower than Python-only capture on loaded hosts. Each child
//!   leads its own process group. On timeout or cancellation the
//!   group is killed so descendants cannot retain inherited pipes;
//!   the direct-child reap has its own one-second bound. The worker
//!   returns `Failed { stderr: "…timed out…" }` on timeout.
//! - **PS-6 (bridge timeout):** The HTTP bridge uses a separate
//!   `MESH_ADMIN_PYSPY_BRIDGE_TIMEOUT` (default 13s), which must
//!   exceed `MESH_ADMIN_PYSPY_TIMEOUT` so the subprocess kill/reap
//!   and reply can arrive before the bridge declares
//!   `gateway_timeout`. Independent of
//!   `MESH_ADMIN_SINGLE_HOST_TIMEOUT`.
//! - **PS-7 (non-blocking delegation):** ProcAgent never awaits
//!   py-spy execution inline. On `PySpyDump` it spawns a child
//!   `PySpyWorker`, forwards the request, and returns immediately.
//! - **PS-8 (worker lifecycle):** Each `PySpyWorker` handles
//!   exactly one forwarded `RunPySpyDump`, replies directly to the
//!   forwarded `OncePortRef`, then self-terminates via
//!   `cx.stop()`. Clean exit, no supervision event.
//! - **PS-9 (concurrent dumps):** py-spy is spawn-per-request, so
//!   overlapping dumps on the same proc are allowed. Each worker
//!   runs independently.
//! - **PS-10 (nonblocking retry):** In nonblocking mode, `try_exec`
//!   retries up to 3 times with 100ms backoff on failure, because
//!   py-spy can segfault reading mutating process memory. Attempts
//!   and backoff share the `MESH_ADMIN_PYSPY_TIMEOUT` deadline;
//!   timeout cleanup has the separate one-second reap bound in PS-5.
//! - **PS-11a (native-all-immediate-downgrade):** If py-spy rejects
//!   `--native-all` with the recognized unsupported-flag signature
//!   (exit code 2, stderr mentions `--native-all`), `try_exec` retries
//!   immediately with `native_all = false` and `native = true` in the
//!   same outer attempt. This also preserves native capture for an
//!   actor caller that supplied `native_all = true, native = false`.
//! - **PS-11b (native-all-no-retry-consumption):** That downgrade
//!   retry does not consume an outer nonblocking retry slot (PS-10)
//!   and does not incur the 100ms inter-attempt backoff.
//! - **PS-11c (native-all-downgrade-warning):** A successful
//!   downgraded result includes
//!   `pyspy::native_all_downgrade_warning(label)`, which names how
//!   the py-spy binary was resolved — PS-3 means the caller cannot
//!   otherwise tell which one ran. The warning survives failed
//!   downgraded outer retries and is attached to any eventual
//!   successful result, whose `capture_mode` is `native`.
//! - **PS-11d (native-all-failure-passthrough):** If the downgraded
//!   retry also fails, the failure flows through the normal
//!   nonblocking retry logic (PS-10) unchanged.
//! - **PS-11e (native-all-sticky-downgrade):** Once the
//!   unsupported-flag signature is detected,
//!   `effective_opts.native_all` remains `false` for all subsequent
//!   outer retries. The flag is not re-tested on later attempts.
//! - **PS-12 (universal py-spy):** Worker procs and the service
//!   proc can handle `PySpyDump`. Worker procs handle it via
//!   ProcAgent; the service proc handles it via HostAgent (same
//!   spawn-worker pattern). `pyspy_bridge` routes to a HostAgent
//!   only when its exact actor identity is registered with the mesh
//!   admin; all other procs route to `proc_agent[0]`. Procs lacking
//!   either agent (e.g. mesh-admin) fast-fail via PS-13.
//! - **PS-13 (defensive probe):** Before sending `PySpyDump`,
//!   `pyspy_bridge` probes the selected actor with an introspect
//!   query bounded by `MESH_ADMIN_QUERY_CHILD_TIMEOUT` (default
//!   100ms). Three outcomes: (a) probe reply arrives — proceed
//!   with `PySpyDump`; (b) probe times out or recv closes —
//!   return `not_found` (actor absent/unreachable); (c) probe
//!   send itself fails — return `internal_error` (bridge-side
//!   infrastructure failure). Cases (b) and (c) fast-fail
//!   instead of waiting the full 13s
//!   `MESH_ADMIN_PYSPY_BRIDGE_TIMEOUT`.
//! - **PS-14 (reachability-based capability):** A proc supports
//!   py-spy iff its stable handler actor is reachable: the
//!   service proc requires a reachable `host_agent`; non-service
//!   procs require a reachable `proc_agent[0]`. `PySpyWorker` is
//!   transient per-request machinery (spawned on `PySpyDump`,
//!   stopped after replying) and is not part of the reachability
//!   contract.
//! - **PS-15a (native-immediate-downgrade):** Native frames matter —
//!   a proc stuck in a collective or an allocator shows nothing
//!   useful without them — but a partial dump beats no dump. If a
//!   capture that requested `--native` or `--native-all` returns
//!   `Failed` for any reason other than the PS-11a unsupported-flag
//!   signature — libunwind rejecting the target with `UNW_EINVAL`,
//!   say — `try_exec` drops both native flags and retries
//!   Python-only in the same outer attempt, and PS-15c says so in
//!   the result.
//! - **PS-15b (native-no-retry-consumption):** That downgrade retry
//!   does not consume an outer nonblocking retry slot (PS-10) and
//!   does not incur the 100ms inter-attempt backoff.
//! - **PS-15c (native-downgrade-warning):** A successful downgraded
//!   result has `capture_mode = python_only` and includes
//!   `pyspy::native_downgrade_warning(label)`. The enum provides a
//!   queryable capture-mode signal, while the warning names both the
//!   py-spy that fell short and the remedy: point the `PYSPY_BIN`
//!   environment variable on the dumped proc at a build that can
//!   unwind the target. The warning survives failed Python-only outer
//!   retries and is attached to any eventual successful result.
//! - **PS-15d (native-sticky-downgrade):** Once native capture has
//!   failed, `effective_opts.native` and `effective_opts.native_all`
//!   remain `false` for all subsequent outer retries. Native is not
//!   re-tested on later attempts.
//!
//! v1 contract notes:
//! - The current py-spy bridge expects a ProcAddr-form reference and
//!   rejects other forms as `bad_request`. This may be broadened in
//!   future versions.
//! - If `worker.send()` fails after the reply port has moved into
//!   `RunPySpyDump`, the caller receives no explicit
//!   `PySpyResult::Failed` — they observe a timeout.
//!   `MailboxSenderError` does not carry the unsent message, so the
//!   port is irrecoverable on this path.
//! - **Contract change (D96756537 follow-up):** `PySpyResult::Ok`
//!   replaced `stack: String` (raw py-spy text) with
//!   `stack_traces: Vec<PySpyStackTrace>` (structured JSON) and
//!   added `warnings: Vec<String>`. Clients reading the old `stack`
//!   field will see it absent; they must migrate to `stack_traces`.
//!
//! ## py-spy profiling (PP-*)
//!
//! Profile capture (`py-spy record`) is a separate contract from
//! dump (`py-spy dump`). Types, messages, workers, and routes are
//! independent — no shared state, no shared timeout budget.
//!
//! - **PP-1 (input validation):** `duration_s` (u32) must be
//!   non-zero and at most `MESH_ADMIN_PYSPY_MAX_PROFILE_DURATION`.
//!   `rate_hz` must be 1..1000. Violations → 400 before any
//!   actor messaging.
//! - **PP-2 (dynamic timeout cascade):** Subprocess timeout =
//!   `duration_s + 15s`. Bridge timeout = subprocess + 5s.
//!   Computed per-request from validated opts, not static config.
//! - **PP-3 (temp file lifecycle):** `py-spy record` writes to a
//!   temp file; the worker reads it after successful exit and
//!   deletes via tempfile drop. On failure or timeout, stderr is
//!   captured. On timeout or cancellation, the child process group
//!   is killed; the direct-child reap has its own one-second bound.
//!   If the file is missing, empty, or unreadable after successful
//!   exit, the result is `OutputMissing`, `OutputEmpty`, or
//!   `OutputReadFailure`, not `Ok`.
//! - **PP-4 (target locality):** Inherits PS-1 — always targets
//!   `std::process::id()`, never a caller-supplied PID.
//! - **PP-5 (separate worker):** `PySpyProfileWorker` is a
//!   distinct actor from `PySpyWorker`. Profile durations block
//!   for seconds to minutes; isolation prevents starving dumps.
//! - **PP-6 (wire projection):** `ProfileExecOutcome` maps to
//!   `PySpyProfileResult` 1:1 via `From`. Every internal variant
//!   has an identically-named wire variant. The only shape change
//!   is `TimedOut.timeout: Duration` → `TimedOut.timeout_s: u64`.
//!
//! ## Mesh-admin config (MA-*)
//!
//! - **MA-C1 (timeout config centralization):** Mesh-admin timeout
//!   budgets are read from config attrs at call-time, with defaults
//!   in `config.rs`. No hardcoded timeout constants in
//!   `mesh_admin.rs`.
